**`parqv` is a Python-based interactive TUI (Text User Interface) tool designed to explore, analyze, and understand Parquet files directly within your terminal.** Forget juggling multiple commands; `parqv` provides a unified, visual experience.

## üíª Demo (Placeholder)

*(A GIF demonstrating the interactive TUI features will go here.)*

Imagine launching `parqv <your_file.parquet>` and instantly getting an interactive view like this, allowing you to navigate through metadata, schema, data, and statistics seamlessly.

## ü§î Why `parqv`?

Parquet is fantastic, but inspecting files can feel clunky:

*   **Fragmented Workflow:** You need separate commands (`parquet-tools meta`, `parquet-tools schema`, `head`, custom scripts) just to get a basic overview. Context switching kills productivity.
*   **Static Output:** Standard CLI tools dump information to the console. Scrolling large outputs, exploring nested structures, or dynamically viewing stats for specific columns is difficult or impossible.
*   **Limited Insight:** Getting beyond basic metadata (like column distributions, detailed row group info, or comparing schemas easily) often requires loading the data into a full analysis environment (Pandas, Spark).
*   **"What's in this file again?":** Quickly understanding the structure, content, and basic statistics of an unfamiliar Parquet file shouldn't be a chore.

**`parqv` revolutionizes Parquet exploration with an interactive TUI:**

1.  **Unified Interface:** Launch `parqv <file.parquet>` to access **metadata, schema, data preview, column statistics, and row group details** all within a single, navigable terminal window. No more memorizing different commands.
2.  **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   **üñ±Ô∏è Keyboard & Mouse Driven:** Navigate using familiar keys (arrows, `hjkl`, Tab) or even your mouse (thanks to `Textual`).
    *   **üìú Scrollable Views:** Easily scroll through large schemas, data tables, or row group lists.
    *   **üå≤ Expandable Schema:** Visualize and navigate complex nested structures (Structs, Lists) effortlessly.
    *   **üìä Dynamic Stats:** Select a column and instantly see its detailed statistics and distribution.
3.  **Enhanced Analysis & Visualization:**
    *   **üé® Rich Display:** Leverages `rich` and `Textual` for colorful, readable tables and syntax-highlighted schema.
    *   **üìà Quick Stats:** Go beyond min/max/nulls. See means, medians, quantiles, distinct counts, frequency distributions, and even text-based histograms.
    *   **üî¨ Row Group Deep Dive:** Inspect individual row groups to understand compression, encoding, and potential data skew.

**`parqv` makes understanding your Parquet files faster, more intuitive, and more insightful, directly from your terminal.**

## ‚ú® Features (TUI Mode)

*   **Interactive TUI:** Run `parqv <file.parquet>` to launch the main interface.
*   **Metadata Panel:** Displays key file information (path, creator, total rows, row groups, compression, etc.).
*   **Schema Explorer:**
    *   Interactive, collapsible tree view for schemas.
    *   Clearly shows column names, data types (including nested types), and nullability.
    *   Syntax highlighting for better readability.
*   **Data Table Viewer:**
    *   Scrollable table preview of the file's data.
    *   Handles large files by loading data pages on demand.
    *   (Planned) Column selection/reordering.
*   **Column Statistics Panel:**
    *   Select a column in the Schema or Data view to see detailed statistics:
        *   Basic: Count, Null Count, Min, Max.
        *   Advanced: Mean, Median, Std Dev, Quantiles, Distinct Count, Top N Frequent Values.
        *   Visual: Text-based histogram for numerical types, length distribution for strings.
*   **Row Group Inspector:**
    *   List all row groups with key stats (row count, compressed/uncompressed size).
    *   Select a row group to view per-column details (encoding, size, stats within the group).
*   **Modern TUI Experience:** Built with [`Textual`](https://textual.textualize.io/) for a smooth, responsive feel.
*   **Efficient Loading:** Uses `pyarrow` to read only necessary metadata or data chunks, keeping memory usage low.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (TUI Mode)

`parqv` operates as a local Python application leveraging the `Textual` TUI framework.

1.  Running `parqv <file.parquet>` starts the `Textual` application.
2.  `pyarrow` is used to efficiently read the Parquet file's footer to extract metadata and schema information without loading the entire dataset.
3.  The TUI layout is rendered, typically including:
    *   A header/footer for status and keybindings.
    *   Navigable panes/tabs for Metadata, Schema, Data, Statistics, and Row Groups.
    *   A main content area displaying the active view's information.
4.  User interactions (key presses, mouse clicks) trigger events.
5.  Based on the event (e.g., selecting a column, scrolling the data table, switching views), `parqv` uses `pyarrow` to:
    *   Read specific data pages for the Data Table view.
    *   Calculate statistics for a selected column (potentially chunk-wise for large files).
    *   Retrieve detailed row group information.
6.  The relevant `Textual` widgets are updated with the new information, refreshing the display.
7.  The application loop continues until the user quits (`q` or `Ctrl+C`).

This architecture prioritizes responsiveness by loading data lazily and using efficient backend libraries.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

We have exciting plans for `parqv`:

*   **‚ú® Schema Diff View:** `parqv diff <file1> <file2>` command launching a TUI to visually compare schemas.
*   **üîç Data Search & Filtering:** Allow searching for values or applying filters within the Data Table view.
*   **üíæ Data Export:** Option to export the currently viewed/filtered data subset to CSV/JSON directly from the TUI.
*   **üìä More Visualizations:** Explore adding more advanced text-based plots (e.g., scatter plots if feasible).
*   **üîß Configuration:** Allow user customization (keybindings, themes, default view) via a config file.
*   **üöÄ Performance Tuning:** Continuously optimize for very large files and complex schemas.
*   **üí° UX Enhancements:** Improve help screens, add more intuitive navigation cues, refine layouts.
*   **(Maybe) Basic Editing:** Potentially add functionality to modify metadata (with strong warnings!).
